Project Name: Project #4 Cookware Website
Decription: Made a website from a prototype that has responsiveness for Desktop (1920px) Tablet (768px) and Mobile L (425px). Three sections use only BOOTSTRAP (New Arrivals) GRID (Best Sellers) & FLEX (Start Cooking). 
Peer: David Monterrosa
>Review: Overall the project does a great job at imitating the prototype. I noticed a few things. One is that you are missing most of the hover effects. Make sure to check the figma UI/UX page to see the specifics of what colors and styling to use on hover. The nav bar should be an offcanvas. Your website scrolls on smaller screen sizes. As you mentioned, there are some spacing differences, such as with the New Arrivals section and the footer. The cards for the best sellers section should also be a little different. Specifically the Fall Bakeware card should be shorter.
